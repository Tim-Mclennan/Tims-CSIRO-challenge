# Tims-CSIRO-challenge

CSIRO provided me a challenge to implement a counter that takes in a user input. I have implemented  buttons that will either increment, decrement or reste the value absed on the user input.

CSIRO's mission and values are ones that I align with on a deep level, and it is an organisation whose achievements are nationally recognised. I hope to be a part of the web solutions team one day.
